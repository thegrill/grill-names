Overview

Digital content encoded in machine-readable formats can be created, viewed and distributed on digital electronics devices without caring how the data is named.

However, for a project with a life cycle like: ``Idea → Encode → Distribution``, going through each stage requires human input, and for that, ease of data tracking and discoverability is a requirement.

At ``the grill``, every project's contribution can be uniquely identified via the :ref:`CGAsset` name.

Contributions will naturally go through multiple iterations, with the most important ones being "snapshot". These snapshots are saved on a filesystem, called ``versions`` of the asset and can be made up of multiple file resources, which can be identified via the :ref:`CGAssetFile` name.
