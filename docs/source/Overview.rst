.. topic:: Grill Names

    This package offers Name objects for digital content creation.

----

Digital content encoded in machine-readable formats can be created, viewed and distributed on digital electronics devices without caring how the data is named.

However, for a creative project with the following stages:

``Idea >> Encode >> Distribution``

Going through each stage requires human input, and for that, ease of data tracking and discoverability is a requirement.

Every contribution to the creative project should be uniquely identified. This is done via the :ref:`CGAsset` name in ``the grill``.

Contributions are reworked and iterated over, versions of said contributions should therefore be a first class citizen. This is solved at the filesystem level via the :ref:`CGAssetFile` name.
