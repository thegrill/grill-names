[domain]
short_name = d
__doc__ = Highest taxonomic rank of organisms: Prokaryota and Eukaryota.
pattern = (Prokaryota|Eukaryota)

[kingdom]
short_name = k
__doc__ = Second highest taxonomic rank, just below domain. Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla.
pattern = (Bacteria|Archaea|Protozoa|Chromista|Plantae|Fungi|Animalia)

[phylum]
short_name=p
__doc__= Level of classification or taxonomic rank below Kingdom and above Class (klass). The term division is usually
    used in botany. Depending on definitions, the animal kingdom Animalia or Metazoa contains approximately 35 phyla,
    the plant kingdom Plantae contains about 14, and the fungus kingdom Fungi contains about 8 phyla.
pattern= \w+

[klass]
short_name = k
__doc__ = Taxonomic rank where there are no hard rules on what a taxonomist needs to follow in describing a class.
    For well-known animals there is likely to be consensus.
pattern = \w+

[order]
short_name = o
__doc__ = Some taxa are accepted almost universally, while others are recognised only rarely. For some groups of
    organisms, consistent suffixes are used to denote that the rank is an order.
pattern = \w+

[family]
short_name = fa
__doc__ = A family may be named after one of its common members; for example, walnuts and hickory trees belong to the
    family Juglandaceae, commonly known as the walnut family.
pattern = \w+

[genius]
short_name = g
__doc__ = Genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of
    the binomial species name for each species within the genus. E.g. Panthera leo (lion) and Panthera onca (jaguar)
    are two species within the genus Panthera. Panthera is a genus within the family Felidae.
pattern = [\w ]+

[species]
short_name = s
__doc__ = Basic unit of classification and a taxonomic rank, as well as a unit of biodiversity. Scientists and
    conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties.
pattern = \w[\w \.]+

[form]
short_name = fo
__doc__ = Strictly informal term without taxonomic significance used to describe organisms.
